        <h2>School preparation</h2>
        <p id="date">15 August 2025</p>
        <p id="bold">
            There are only two weeks left until school starts and preparation's going well. 
                    I have all of my supplies and I am practicing daily to improve my English skills 
                    and reviewing basic algebra to get my brain ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have created a study schedule to help me manage my time effectively. 
            It will need to be adjusted based on my timetable and extracurricular activities, but it's a good starting point. 
            This includes allocating specific hours for homework, revision, and extracurricular activities. 
            I'm making sure to get enough rest and maintain a healthy diet to keep my energy levels up.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also plan to set up a dedicated study space at home, free from distractions, 
            to help me focus better, which I am already working on. Additionally, I'm looking forward to reconnecting with friends 
            and meeting new teachers. Overall, I'm excited and a bit nervous about the new school year, 
            but I believe that with proper preparation, it will be a successful one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I'm planning to set some academic and personal goals for the school year. 
            This includes aiming for high grades in my subjects, participating in at least one extracurricular activity, 
            and making new friends. I believe that having clear goals will keep me motivated throughout the year.
        </p>

            I was able to finish VÃ½fuk, which is a physics competition for middle school students, and I am waiting for the results.
            I started solving a problem set from Fykos, which is a physics competition for high school students.
            Finally, I found two more competitions I want to look into: M&M (from Matfyz) and a Prase(math competition).
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also preparing for the English exam, which I will take the second day of school.
        </p>

            I am making proggress on my website as well. I have created a new post template and I am working on styling it with CSS.
            I also want to add a contact form, but I need to learn how to handle the data first.
            I completed the first section on Codecademy, which was about HTML and CSS basics.
            I will continue with the next sections to learn more about web development, 
            including building interactive websites using Javascript and making websites accesible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I am feeling prepared and excited for the new school year. 
            I know there will be challenges, but I am ready to face them head-on and make the most of my high school experience.
