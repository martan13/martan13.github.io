        <h2>First school update</h2>
        <p id="date">21 September 2025</p>
        <p id="bold">Hi, there! I am back with an update. 
                    It`s been quite a while since I posted my first blog post and it`s been three wiiks, since school started, 
                so it`s safe to say a TON has happened.</p>
        <p>The firs day of school went smoothly. 
            Our teacher introduced himself and we went over the basics including some rules and what we should focus on.</p>
        <p>
            The second day was a bit more challenging. 
            We had our first test in English and I was quite nervous about it. 
            However, I managed to do well and felt more confident about my English skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that poin on, things started to get move quickly.It felt like there was no slow start, just picking up where we left of last year. 
            We had long school days, with classes running from 8 AM to 4 PM, and a lot of homework to keep up with. 
            We evan had a test from biology after just a week of classes and we have more comming up next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this led to me falling behind on personal projects, including this blog. 
            I had to prioritize school work and catch up on assignments, which left me with little time for anything else.
            However, I am determined to find a balance and make time for my blog and other interests. 
            I find it very unfortunate, how school impacts my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am trying ti catch up and I think I`m doing a good job so far. Evan if I don`t manage to do everything, I`m still 
            trying and making progress. I`m looking forward to sharing more updates with you all soon.
